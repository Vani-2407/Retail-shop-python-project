# Retail-shop-python-project
A Python mini-project that simulates a retail shopping experience with category-wise products, OTP verification, and bill generation.
This project is a command-line based retail shopping simulation built using pure Python. It mimics an e-commerce flow where users can select from three categories — Men, Women, and Kids — and are redirected to Amazon or Flipkart product pages.After selecting a product, users enter the quantity, and the total cost is calculated. An OTP is then sent to their phone using Twilio for identity verification.
Once verified, a bill is generated in .txt format showing product and user details. The project includes simple animations and ends with a simulated order confirmation message.Developed as a learning project, it uses multiple Python files (home.py, cart.py, payment.py, etc.) to demonstrate modular programming, Twilio API integration, and file handling.
